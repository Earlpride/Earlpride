- 👋 Hi, I’m Artem!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... low-level programming and software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... WebDev, Java and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me ... if you are reading this, you probably already know how to reach me.

- 🤔 If you are a recruiter or potential employer reading this ... this github is possibly of little interest to you since it's lacking any kind of significant respository - for now, as this subject to change once I have firmly put my foot in the door of the business world.
- 💻 I am going to upload the source code of my final project on here after graduating on in September of the year of the LLMs
